## Project decription
- The goal of my project is to create a sci-fi story generator that is able to produce a short, couple paragraph long sci-fi story based off of previously written sci-fi stories.
- I plan to use a mix of short stories that already exist combined with a sci-fi story generator I found online to create my dataset.
